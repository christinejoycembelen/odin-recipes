        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Calabaza squash and string beans cooked in coconut milk.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp or shrimp heads (you can also use pork)</li>
            <li>Coconut milk</li>
            <li>Squash</li>
            <li>Long beans</li>
            <li>Garlic and onion</li>
            <li>Chili</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Saute the aromatics. </strong>Saute onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add fish sauce and continue to cook for at least one minute while stirring.</li>
            <li><strong>Add coconut milk and chili peppers.</strong> If you want the dish to have a thicker broth, boil it for 3 to 5 minutes on low heat. Since i like mine soup-y, I add the squash around the same time so it can cook faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Add squash and long beans. </strong>Cook the squash for 3 to 5 minutes or until fork tender but not falling apart. Add the long beans next and cook for 3 to 5 minutes as well or until tender-crisp.</li>
            <li><Strong>Add shrimp or shrimp heads. </Strong>Add shrimp and continue to cook for about 5 minutes or until the color changes. </li>
            <li><strong>Season and serve. </strong>Season with salt and pepper to taste. I also season mine with sugar just in case it's not sweet enough for me. Serve and eat with hot steamed rice.</li>
        </ol>
