        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Filipino dish made with thinly sliced meat (beef, pork, carabao, or even horse). It is often served for breakfast with eggs and garlic rice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef (breakfast steak)</li>
            <li>1/4 C Sugar</li>
            <li>6 T Soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 can of pineapple juice</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix and boil. </strong>Add all ingredients to the pot and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the taste. </strong>Try the broth (?) once it boils so you can adjust the amount of sugar or soy sauce as you see fit. Remove scum as it continues to boil. Lower down heat and continue cooking until beef is tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Store or serve. </strong>Cool it down and store it in the fridge. Fry until toasted to your liking.</li>
