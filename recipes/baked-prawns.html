        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine the ingredients for the filling.</strong> In a bowl, add softened butter, mayo, grated cheese, minced garlic, and salt and pepper. Mix well to combine and place in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Butterfly the shrimp.</strong> Cut the shell with kitchen scissors and devein the shrimp using a toothpick. Slice the meat at the center, but do not cut all the way through. Open up the shrimp and lay it flat. Finally, arrange the shrimps on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper. <em><strong>Optional: </strong>Remove the heads of the shrimps. You can use these for stocks or to add flavor to other side dishes.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Add filling to shrimps. </strong>Add a spoonful of the butter-mayo-cheese mixture to each butterflied shrimp. <em><strong>Optional: </strong>Sprinkle quick-melt cheese on top for more cheesiness.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Bake. </strong>Bake the shrimp in a preheated oven at 400°F for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve. </strong>Baste the shrimp with the melted butter from the filling and transfer to a plate. Squeeze calamansi on the shrimp and serve while still warm.</li>
        </ol>
